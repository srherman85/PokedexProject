# What is a Sprint?

## Introduction

In the context of software development and particularly within Agile methodologies like Scrum, a "sprint" refers to a set period during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.

Sprints typically last between **one and four weeks** and are designed to help teams break down big, complex projects into smaller, more manageable pieces. During a sprint, the team works to complete a set amount of work, which is defined by the **Sprint Backlog**.

- The **Product Backlog** is a high-level repository of all the features, user stories, enhancements, and fixes that could be part of the product. It is essentially a dynamic to-do list for the project, constantly evolving as the product evolves.

- The **Sprint Backlog** is a subset of the Product Backlog that contains the items that the development team has committed to delivering during the current sprint. The Development Team is responsible for selecting the items from the Product Backlog and breaking them down into smaller tasks that can be completed within the sprintâ€™s time-box
  - Updating. For this course the **Sprint Backlog** should be updated as much as possible. In a real development environment that would be daily.

## Real World

**Daily Stand-Up or Daily Scrum:**  Discuss what they did the previous day, what they will do today, and any blockers or obstacles they're facing. Use check-ins via Microsoft Teams or GitHub to ensure group members are aligned.

## Academic World

**Weekly Stand-Up or Weekly Scrum:** Use check-ins via Microsoft Teams or GitHub to ensure group members are aligned. This can be a mix of virtual meetings and issue-based discussions. Discuss what they did the previous week, what they will plan for the next week. Discuss any blockers or obstacles they're facing. They should be updating Issues for many of the blockers and obstacles.

## Review & Feedback

Post each sprint, have a comprehensive review what has been completed. This review should include functionality, documentation clarity, and usability. Use GitHub's PR (Pull Request) mechanism to review, comment, and suggest changes to both code and documentation.

## Deliverables and Quality Assurance

The final deliverables should not only be functional but also adhere to best practices in terms of code quality, documentation clarity, and usability. Use tools like pytest for automated testing of your Web Application. Documentation should undergo peer reviews and be easily understandable by someone unfamiliar with the project.

## Emphasis on Collaboration and Feedback

Given the importance of collaboration in both Agile and DevOps, leverage GitHub for transparent communication, issue tracking, and version control. Encourage members to comment, review, and provide feedback continuously. Use GitHub Issues for feedback and integrate this feedback loop into each sprint.

## Conclusion

Regular feedback loops, automated testing, and continuous integration of changes will pave the way for a successful and efficient project completion. It's worth noting that while "sprints" are specifically a Scrum term, many other Agile methodologies use similar time-boxed iterations with different names.

In terms of software testing, within a sprint, testing is typically integrated as a continuous activity. Unlike traditional "waterfall" methodologies where testing might be its own phase after all development is complete, in Agile and Scrum, testing is ongoing. As features are developed, they are tested, ensuring a potentially shippable product increment by the end of each sprint.
