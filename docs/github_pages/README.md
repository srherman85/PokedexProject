# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. It's an efficient way to host project, user, or organization sites directly from a GitHub repository. Here's a quick tutorial on how to use GitHub Pages:

## Step 1: Set Up a GitHub Account 
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one at github.com. It's a straightforward process that involves providing an email address, creating a username, and setting a password.

## Step 2: Create a New Repository 
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
3. Name your repository. For user or organization sites, the repository must be named {username}.github.io or {organization}.github.io. For project sites, the name can be anything.
4. Choose if you want the repository to be public (anyone can see) or private (only you can see).
5. Initialize the repository with a README, if you like.
6. Click "Create repository."

## Step 3: Add Your Content
1. Clone the repository to your computer using Git, or use GitHub's web interface to add files.
2. Add your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. For a simple site, you might just need an index.html file.
3. Commit and push your changes if you're using Git, or simply commit the changes on the web interface.

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository's settings on GitHub.
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
3. Select the branch you want to deploy your site from (usually main or master).
4. Optionally, choose a theme or upload a custom one.
5. Click "Save" or "Select theme."

## Step 5: Access Your Site
Once GitHub Pages is enabled and your site is published, you can access it through the URL provided in the GitHub Pages section of your repository settings. The URL typically follows this format: https://{username}.github.io for user or organization sites, or https://{username}.github.io/{repository} for project sites.

## Additional Features and Tips
Custom Domains: GitHub Pages allows you to use your own domain instead of the github.io domain.
- Jekyll Support: GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll, a static site generator. This allows you to create blog posts, page templates, and more.
- GitHub Actions: For more complex build processes, you can use GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy your site.
- GitHub Pages is a powerful tool for hosting static websites, portfolios, project documentation, and more. Its integration with GitHub's version control capabilities makes it easy to update and manage your site's content.
