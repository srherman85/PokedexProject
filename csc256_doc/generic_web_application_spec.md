# Web Application Testing Generic FURPS+/User Stories

**Each team will have to modify to implement user stories for their specific Web Application.**

Develop a web application using Flask or Django  that can be used to demonstrate testing using SELENIUM or PLAYWRIGHT.

## FURPS+ Requirements

### Functionality

- Requirement: The web application must provide specific functionalities (like user login, data retrieval, etc.) and be testable using Playwright or Selenium.  **See Mandatory Selenium and Playwright Testable Requirements.
- User Story: As a user, I want to interact with various features of the web application and expect them to function correctly.

### Usability

- Requirement: The application should have a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and clear error messages.
- User Story: As a user, I want the web application to be easy to navigate and use, and as a tester, I want to ensure usability is maintained across different browsers and devices using automation tools.

### Reliability

- Requirement: The application should handle errors gracefully and maintain consistent performance under different conditions.
- User Story: As a user, I expect reliable performance, and as a tester, I aim to use automation testing to uncover any reliability issues.

### Performance

- Requirement: The application should load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions.
- User Story: As a user, I expect a fast and responsive web application, and as a developer, I will utilize Playwright or Selenium to benchmark and improve performance.

### Supportability

- Requirement: The application should be easy to maintain and update, with a focus on testability.
- User Story: As a developer, I want to ensure that the application is built with maintainability in mind, with comprehensive test suites using Playwright or Selenium for ongoing support.

### Plus (+) - Design, Implementation, Interface, Physical

- Design Requirement: The application should be designed with a focus on test automation, including accessible elements and consistent UI patterns.
- Implementation Requirement: Implement the application using Flask or Django which are compatible with Playwright or Selenium.
- Interface Requirement: The application should provide a web interface that is consistently testable across different browsers and devices.
- Physical Requirement: Ensure the application can be deployed in a standard web environment and tested in both local and CI/CD setups.

### Additional User Stories for Development and Testing

- Automated Functional Testing

  - As a tester, I want to create automated tests using Playwright or Selenium to validate all key functionalities of the web application.

- Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Testing
  - As a tester, I need to ensure that the web application works consistently across various browsers and devices, using Playwright or Selenium for automated cross-browser testing.

- Error Handling and Edge Case Testing

  - As a tester, I aim to test how the application handles errors and edge cases, ensuring robust error handling and validation.

- Performance Testing

  - As a developer, I want to test the performance of the web application under different load conditions using automation tools.

- User Experience Testing
  - As a tester, I plan to automate scenarios that mimic real user interactions to ensure the application delivers a positive user experience.

- Regression Testing
  - As a developer, I need automated regression tests to ensure new changes don't break existing functionalities.

- Accessibility Testing
  - As a developer, I want to ensure the application is accessible, using automation tools to check compliance with accessibility standard
