# CSC 256 Group Project

## Project Overview

This project is an intensive team-based educational venture where students will engage in the design and development of a comprehensive series of laboratory exercises centered around various software testing methodologies using Python as the primary programming language.

### Key Areas

- Development of Python applications with thorough testing.
- Crafting detailed test plans and understanding software specifications.
- Covering various testing types such as unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

### Collaboration and Assessment

- Monitoring interactions and contributions on GitHub and Microsoft Teams.
- Evaluating coding, documentation, testing, and problem-solving aspects.
- Ensuring effective team collaboration in planning and decision-making.

## Project Structure

- **Agile Development:** Divided into four sprints with full team engagement.
- **Team Composition:** Teams of 5-6 members. There are three primary tasks: code development,  documentation and testing.

- **Collaboration Tools:**
  - Microsoft Teams for meetings, stand-ups, and discussions.
  - GitHub for code development, testing, documentation, and collaboration.

## Python Web Application

First you will have to develop a Python-based web application that serves a specific purpose (e.g., a simple e-commerce site, a blog platform, a task management tool, etc.). This application will be used as the basis for applying various testing methodologies. Once the web application is developed you will design labs that instruct on how to use of various software testing tools identified below.

Technologies: Python, Flask, or Django (for the web framework), SQLite or PostgreSQL (for the database)

## Phases of the Project

### Sprint 1: Agile Development with TDD

- **Task:** Sprint planning and Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation for the Python web application with core features and API endpoints.
- **Output:**
  - A Python web application with basic features and API endpoints, developed iteratively following TDD principles.
  - A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests, validating the functionality of the application at every stage of development.

### Sprint 2: API Testing with Postman and Requests

- **Task:** Focus on RESTful API testing using Postman, and automate these tests using Python's Requests library.
- **Output:** A Postman collection and Python scripts for automated API testing.

### Sprint 3: Web Application Testing with Selenium or Playwright

- **Task:** Automate web application testing, focusing on user interactions and dynamic content testing.
- **Output:** A set of automated browser tests.
- Required Tests for Selenium and Playwright can be found in the csc256_doc folder.

### Sprint 4: Testing with Robot Framework

- **Task:** Utilize Robot Framework for higher-level acceptance and integration tests.
- **Output:** A suite of Robot Framework tests covering critical user journeys and features.

## Group Deliverables

- Comprehensive documentation of the development and testing process.
- Requirement documentation, test plan, and cases.
- Lab-specific preparation documentation and execution.
  - For Each Tool: Include setup documentation, preparation guides, and short tutorials tailored to the specific objectives of the lab.
  - Tutorials: Step-by-step guides to assist students in setting up the environment, understanding the tool's functionalities, and executing the labs.
  - Lab Preparation: Outline pre-lab activities, required readings or resources, and prerequisite knowledge or skills.
  - Lab Execution Documentation: Document the execution process, including the steps taken, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.
- Documented presentation discussing tests and key learnings.
- A well-organized code repository with all code, tests, and documentation.

## Individual Deliverables

- Peer Evaluations and Updates as required

## Additional Considerations

- Regular peer reviews and version control using Git.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Assessment:** Group Grades are based on collaboration (evaluated via GitHub and Teams usage) and the quality of the final deliverables. **Individual** final grades will have additional assessement based on peer evaluations.

### Code Quality and Documentation

- **Code Review:** Ensuring code adheres to best practices and is well-documented.
- **Documentation:** Clear and comprehensive documentation for each development and testing phase.

### Testing and Problem Solving

- **Testing:** Effective and thorough testing practices, covering all required aspects.
- **Problem Solving:** Demonstrating problem-solving skills in addressing challenges.

### Instructional Student Labs

- **Content Quality and Relevance:** Evaluate how accurately and comprehensively the lab covers the software testing tools. It should include essential features, best practices, and real-world applications.
- **Instructional Design:** Structure and organization of the lab. It should have a clear, logical flow that builds from basic concepts to more advanced ones.
- **Hands-On Components:** Evaluate the quality and relevance of the exercises and projects. They should allow students to apply concepts in real or simulated environments.
- **Learning Outcomes:** Does the lab have clearly defined learning outcomes. Students should know what skills and knowledge they are expected to gain.

### Collaboration and Communication

- **Teamwork:** Effective team collaboration, contributing equally to the project.
- **Communication:** Clear and consistent communication within the team and in documentation.

## Submission Guidelines

- **Repository:** All project materials to be submitted in a GitHub repository.
- **Final Presentation:** A presentation summarizing the project, challenges, and learnings.
- **Documentation:** Submit all relevant documentation as part of the final deliverable.
